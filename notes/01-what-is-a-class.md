# What is a Class?

## Simple Explanation

A **class** is like a blueprint or recipe for creating something in your code.

## Example: Think of a Cookie Cutter

- A cookie cutter is the **class** (the shape/blueprint)
- Each cookie you make is an **object** (a real thing made from the blueprint)
- You can make many cookies from one cookie cutter!

## In Our Game

```python
class Game:
```

This creates a blueprint called `Game`. When we write `Game()`, we create an actual game object from that blueprint!

## Parts of a Class

- `__init__`: This is the "setup" function that runs when you create the object
- `self`: Refers to "this specific object" (like saying "my cookie" vs "your cookie")
- Methods: Functions inside a class (like `update()` and `draw()`)

## Why Use Classes?

Classes help organize your code by keeping related things together - all the game stuff stays in the Game class!
