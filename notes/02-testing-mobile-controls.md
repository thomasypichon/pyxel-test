# Testing Mobile Controls

## Why Mobile Controls Matter

When your game runs on a phone or tablet, players don't have a keyboard! Pyxel automatically adds special touch buttons on the screen for mobile players.

## How to Test Mobile Controls - Super Easy! 🎮

1. Click the play button (▶️) in Cursor
2. Select **"📱 Test Mobile Version"**
3. Browser opens automatically!
4. In the browser:
   - Press `Cmd + Option + I` (Developer Tools)
   - Press `Cmd + Option + M` (mobile mode)
   - Select "iPad" or "iPhone"
   - Refresh the page
5. **BAM!** You'll see touch controls on screen! 🎮

## What You'll See

When in mobile mode, Pyxel shows:
- **Arrow buttons** for moving (up, down, left, right)
- **Action buttons** for game actions (like shooting or jumping)

These replace the keyboard controls, so players can tap the screen to play!

## Why This Is Cool

- You can test if your game works well on phones
- You can see how the controls look to mobile players
- You can make sure buttons aren't blocking important parts of your game

## Bonus: Cursor Stays Visible!

The mouse cursor stays visible so you can easily click the mobile touch buttons. This makes testing much easier!

## When Done Testing

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the web server.

**Remember:** The mobile controls only show up in mobile mode. When testing on desktop normally, players will use their keyboard like usual!
